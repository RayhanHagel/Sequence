# Sequence
 Sequence consists of multiple number sequence algorithm
 
## Levine's Sequence
This is a triangular puzzle sequence made by Lionel Levine. For more information about Lionel Levine's Sequence, you could read the documentation made by [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Seqeunce](https://oeis.org/A011784).

## Kolakoski Sequence
Kolakoski sequence or Oldenburger-Kolakoski sequence is a sequence that describes its own run length infinitely. For more information about the Kolakoski Sequence, you could read the documentation made by [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Seqeunce](https://oeis.org/A000002)

## Prime Number Sequence
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
