# Sequence
 Sequence consists of multiple number sequence algorithm
 
## Levine's Sequence
This is a triangular puzzle sequence made by Lionel Levine. For more information about Lionel Levine's Sequence, you could read the documentation made by [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Seqeunce](https://oeis.org/A011784).

## Kolakoski Sequence
Kolakoski sequence or Oldenburger-Kolakoski sequence is a sequence that describes its own run length infinitely. For more information about the Kolakoski Sequence, you could read the documentation made by [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Seqeunce](https://oeis.org/A000002).

## Prime Number Sequence
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

## Fibonacci Sequence
Fibonacci sequence is a sequence that consists of numbers where the next term is the sum of two terms before it. F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). For more information about this, please proceed to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

## Tribonacci Sequence
The tribonacci numbers are like the Fibonacci numbers, but instead of starting with two predetermined terms, the sequence starts with three predetermined terms and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding three terms. The first few tribonacci numbers are:
0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, 149, 274, 504, 927, 1705, 3136, 5768, 10609, 19513, 35890, 66012, â€¦
More about Tribonacci Numbers could be read trough [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribonacci_number)
